## Press Pause ⏸️
### From Digital to Analog Media
#### JAC Hacks 2025

The purpose of the **Press Pause** ⏸️ app is to provide *analog* packages of books, movie DVDs, music album CDs, games and other physical media for users wanting to be more intentional with their content consumption. It takes users' interests and generates a few compilations of physical media for the month. It's not like any other subscription: you OWN the media at the end of the day.

Press Pause ⏸️ is about slowing down and choosing what to set our minds on, instead of scrolling infinitely and losing time on brainrot. Instead of trying to cut out technology entirely, let's just return to the early 2000s, to a simpler time in the tech age.

The web app is built with **Angular** and makes use of **MongoDB Atlas** for storing and retriving user data through an API.

We chose to style this app in a somewhat "ugly" way mimicking the early 2000s to discourage users from spending too much time on it, keeping in mind the purpose of the app in the first place: to press pause, go offline and be more mindful of our consumption choices.

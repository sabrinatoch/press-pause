## Press Pause
### JAC Hacks 2025

The purpose of the **Press Pause** app is to provide *analog* packages of books, movie DVDs, music album CDs, games and other physical media for users wanting to be more intentional with their content consumption. It takes users' interests and generates a compilation of physical media that can be purchased, rented or borrowed from the library. Links are included to make the process faster and more convenient.

Press Pause provides is about slowing down and choosing what to set our minds on, instead of scrolling infinitely and losing time on brainrot. Instead of trying to cut out technology entirely, let's just return to the early 2000s, to a simpler time in the tech age.

The web app is built with **Angular**, making use of **MongoDB** for storing user data.

We chose to style this app in a somewhat "ugly" way to discourage users from spending too much time on it, keeping in mind the purpose of the app in the first place: to press pause, go offline and be more mindful of our consumption choices.
